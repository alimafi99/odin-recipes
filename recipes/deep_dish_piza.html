            <p><li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, 5 to 10 minutes. </li></p>
            <p><li>Combine yeast mixture, flour, corn oil, and kosher salt in a large stand mixer fitted with the dough hook; knead until dough holds together but is still slightly sticky, about 2 minutes.  </li></p>
            <p><li>Form dough into a ball and transfer to a buttered bowl. Turn to coat dough with butter, then cover the bowl with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 6 hours.  </li></p>
            <p><li>Punch down dough and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Press dough into a 10-inch deep-dish pizza pan and follow your pizza recipe.  </li></p>
            <p><li>Add cheese, toppings, and tomatoes that you've flavored with garlic, basil, oregano, etc. Bake the pizza in an oven preheated to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for about 30 minutes, depending on your oven. You can prebake the crust for 10-15 minutes before adding toppings if desired. </li></p>
